## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The design for this project was a little bit tricky, mainly the pentagon shape of the choices and since the background image provided was not a perfect shape, it meant that I would be doing a lot of transforming of the Y and X-axis for the choice button elements,
at least that was the first thing that came to my mind. Still, the main problem I faced was the layout of the choice elements themselves and how I would place them in a pentagon shape. I tried flexbox initially, turns out it is possible, but I didn't want to waste most of my hairline on this project alone. Thankfully, `grid-template-areas` came to the rescue, cut my code solution by 60%, and even solved my layout issues for the tablet and desktop views in the rules and results sections.

Here are some code snippets of my use of grid-template-areas:

```css
/* Rules */
@media screen and (min-width: 1366px) {
  .rules {
    grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
    grid-template-areas:
      'p . . b'
      'i i i i';
  }
  /*
  p - paragraph
  b - button
  i - image
  */

/* Choices */
.main__content {
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-areas:
    '. s .'
    'c . p'
    'l . r';
}

/* Results */
  .main__content--results {
    grid-template: 'p r h' 1fr;
    grid-column-gap: 0;
  }
```

  - This article is a fantastic read by Rachel Andrew covering G-T-A in detail, which helped me immensely during this project. I think it's definitely worth the read if you want to dive deep into this topic.
